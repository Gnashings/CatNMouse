# CatNMouse
A little simulation of a cat and mouse running around in a maze.

enter any key, and hit enter to iterate through.

I just read the level from a txt file meaning you technically create your own levels:
X = wall, nothing will pass through.
0 = cheese, for Mice!
1 = mouse, our hero.
2 = cat, our misunderstood villain.

Pathways must be cardinal. Ideally the map is 16x16 and square, and walled all around.
As of now, I don't run checks to see if maps are made correctly, so do so at your own risk!
