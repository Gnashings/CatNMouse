# CatNMouse
A little simulation of a cat and mouse running around in a maze.

hit enter to iterate through.

I just read the level from a txt file meaning you technically create your own levels:
X = wall, nothing will pass through.
0 = cheese, for Mice!
M = mouse, our hero.
C = cat, our misunderstood villain.

Pathways must be cardinal. maps must be 16x16, and walled all around.
